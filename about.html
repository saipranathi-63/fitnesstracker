        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>At FitTrack, we're passionate about helping you understand your fitness journey through accurate, science-based calorie tracking.</p>
        <p>Our platform was born from a simple idea: exercise tracking should be precise, personalized, and practical. We've built a comprehensive system that calculates calories burned during any workout by analyzing multiple factors specific to you and your activities.</p>
        <h2>Our Approach</h2>
        <p>FitTrack uses advanced metabolic calculations based on established exercise science to provide accurate calorie expenditure data. We consider your unique profile—including weight, height, age, and gender—alongside detailed exercise parameters like duration, intensity, and specific movements.</p>        
        <p>Unlike basic calorie calculators, our system employs Metabolic Equivalent of Task (MET) values, the gold standard in exercise energy expenditure estimation. This approach delivers personalized results that adapt as your fitness level evolves.</p>        
        <h2>What Sets Us Apart</h2>       
        <p>Our focus on precision, personalization, and versatility makes FitTrack the ideal tool for anyone serious about tracking their fitness progress. We provide visual insights into your workout data and help you set and achieve meaningful fitness goals.</p>       
        <h2>Our Mission</h2>       
        <p>We believe that understanding the energy you expend during exercise is fundamental to achieving your fitness goals. Whether you're looking to lose weight, build endurance, or simply maintain an active lifestyle, FitTrack provides the insights you need to make informed decisions about your health journey.</p>       
        <p>Join us and discover a more thoughtful way to track your fitness progress—one accurate calorie calculation at a time.</p>
